# This module contains functions that generate demo gate objects. Both the code and
# the objects they return are used to render some auto-generated cells in our jupyter
# notebooks.
#
# The above imports are the imports guaranteed to be in a jupyter notebook. For bespoke
# imports, use a local import in your function. This will be rendered into the notebook as well.
#
# These functions must have a globally unique name, take no arguments, and finish with
# a `return` statement from which we can extract an expression that will be rendered into
# a notebook template.
